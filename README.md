# Smart-irrigation-system

make sure to install LiquidCrystal_I2C library.

right now only 1 moisture snsor is connected on A0.

manual switch at d2 is used to turn on/off pump manually.

automode switch at d3 is used to turn on/off pump autpmatically when moisture level is low or normal.

dry sense at d4 is to make sure that water is coming else after 10 seond pump will automatically turns off (feature to be added)

pump at d5


code needs some minor fixes till now
